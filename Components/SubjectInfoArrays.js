However, the 20th century saw major developments in physics as existing theories and models were challenged by new observations that could not be explained. These observations led to the development of quantum theory and the theory of relativity. <br/> Technologies arising from these theories have shaped the modern world. For example, the independence of the speed of light on the frame of observation or the motion of the source and observer had significant consequences for the measurement, and concepts about the nature, of time and space.

                topicDescription: <> Humans have always been fascinated with the finite or infinite state of the Universe and whether there ever was a beginning to time. Where does all the matter that makes up the Universe come from? Ideas and theories about the beginnings of the Universe, based on sound scientific evidence, have come and gone. Current theories such as the Big Bang theory and claims of an expanding Universe are based on scientific evidence available today through investigations that use modern technologies. Evidence gathered on the nucleosynthesis reactions in stars allows scientists to understand how elements are made in the nuclear furnace of stars. <br/> On scales as large as the Universe to those as small as an atom, humans look to the sky for answers through astronomical observations of stars and galaxies. Beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, experimental discoveries revolutionised the accepted understanding of the nature of matter on an atomic scale. Observations of the properties of matter and light inspired the development of better models of matter, which in turn have been modified or abandoned in the light of further experimental investigations. <br/> By studying the development of the atomic models through the work of Thomson and Rutherford, who established the nuclear model of the atom - a positive nucleus surrounded by electrons - students further their understanding of the limitations of theories and models. The work of Bohr, de Broglie and, later, Schrödinger demonstrated that the quantum mechanical nature of matter was a better way to understand the structure of the atom. Experimental investigations of the nucleus have led to an understanding of radioactive decay, the ability to extract energy from nuclear fission and fusion, and a deeper understanding of the atomic model. Particle accelerators have revealed that protons themselves are not fundamental, and have continued to provide evidence in support of the Standard Model of matter. <br/> In studying this module, students can appreciate that the fundamental particle model is forever being updated and that our understanding of the nature of matter remains incomplete. </>,

They also examine the interactions and relationships that can occur between objects by modelling and representing these using vectors and equations. In many situations, within and beyond the discipline of physics, knowing the rates of change of quantities provides deeper insight into various phenomena. <br/> In this module, the rates of change of displacement, velocity and energy are of particular significance and students develop an understanding of the usefulness and limitations of modelling. </>,

Students examine mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves, including their similarities and differences. <br/> Students also examine energy and its transfer, in the form of heat, from one place to another. Thermodynamics is the study of the relationship between energy, work, temperature and matter. Understanding this relationship allows students to appreciate particle motion within objects. Students have the opportunity to examine how hot objects lose energy in three ways: first, by conduction, and, second, by convection - which both involve the motion of particles; and, third, the emission of electromagnetic radiation. An understanding of thermodynamics is a pathway to understanding related concepts in many fields involving Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). </>,

                topicDescription: <>Imagine that you have been contracted by a representative from 'Green Construction', a company that is designing a range of industrial machines built from cardboard. This will reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry by utilising reusable materials. <br/> They have employed you and three teammates on a ten-week contract to build a scale model of the 'Cardboard Hydraulic Arm', and have asked you to design and construct a hydraulic arm made of cardboard that is capable of lifting and moving heavy objects. In addition to the creation of the prototype, they have asked you to create a project portfolio to track the process of design and construction. The project portfolio will be presented to the company at the end of the project.</>,

                topicDescription: <>Imagine that you have been contacted by Alex, an Educational Liaison Officer (ELO) from “General Automotive”, a large car manufacturer centred in Victoria. Alex has reached out to you to offer you a job in their Mechanics division, on the condition that you demonstrate four (4) key skills. <br/> To get the job, you must have a demonstrated ability to: <br/> 1. Follow instructions precisely and efficiently; <br/> 2. Use creative thinking to modify and improve design plans; <br/> 3. Conduct an Occupational Health and Safety Risk Assessment;  <br/> 4. Abide by all safety policies and procedures in the workplace. <br/><br/> Therefore, for this assessment task you are going to use LEGO 'dacta' kits to demonstrate these four key skills by building a range of LEGO machines, designing and constructing your own machine, and using Risk Assessment strategies to work safely in the classroom.</>,

You have been given access to a range of constructions materials and technology to complete this, including cardboard, ultrasonic sensors, Arduinos, and Raspberry Pis.</>,
